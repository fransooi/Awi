Which means (this is not legal text, just the intention when writing it)...

If it is a for a good cause, you can make money from it and your work.

The licence will pass to others using your branch of modifications, so
it will be free as well for them for good causes, and you will be 
able to exploit the licence of your modifications without owning 
royalties to me. 

The licence will grow from branch to branch, only for good causes, 
it is not a ponzi scheme as the flow of money is cut at every new branch. 
Profits can only go up, except for the FIRST and ONLY creator of the branch.
A simple tree structure.

If you are using this code for other purposes then it is subject to 
royalties to be negociated, please contact me: fl@helloawi.com
