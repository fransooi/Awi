Let's create a procedure together.
==================================
To create a working procedure, I need you to input information in a simple 
short and descriptive way, step by step.

Step 1: the name of your procedure.
-----------------------------------
Please enter the name of the procedure to create. In order for me to
understand better, the name should describe the function. For example,
"ConnectToWebSocketServer", "MakeBobMoveRight", "DeleteNames" etc.

Your turn:```

ai-code-info-1: 
<BR>
Step 2: the name of the parameters.
-----------------------------------
Please enter the names of the parameters of the procedure, separated by a 
comma. As for the name of the procedure, use descriptive names. String 
parameter names should end with a dollar sign. Example: url$, count, 
description$ etc...

Your turn:```

ai-code-info-2: 
<BR>
Step 3: what the procedure should do.
-------------------------------------
Step-by-step, give a short description of the balls of the procedure.
No need to go too much in details. Examples:
1. connect to a Websocket server,
2. if connected send message "Hello!"
or:
1. extract the work "AOZ" from the description
2. add "Studio" to it...
3. invert all letters of the string
etc.

Your turn:```

ai-code-info-3: 
Step 4: return value.
---------------------
If the procedure should return a value, indicate it by refering to the ball.
Examples:
- the drive letter
- if the connection was succesful
- etc.
Your turn:```

ai:code-info-4: 
<BR>
Step 4: network job?
--------------------
Is this procedure is related to networking or Internet?
Yes or (n)o?```

ai:code-info-5: 
<BR>
Step 5: confirmation.
---------------------
Please check all your entries before confirmation.
Do you want to proceed? (y)es/no?```

ai:code-info-6: One moment please...``

ai:code-complete: 
Warning: this technology is new, the result is not garanteed to
work. Please check the code and type yes or no...
Do you accept the proposition?
